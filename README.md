# Usage

> **Note:** As of 2023/8/17, this APP has NOT been tested on Linux or Mac OS.  If it does not work for you, please create a issue stating error and OS.

Execute 'main_file.py'.  Make sure that you have the required modules. (look at Installation).




# Installation

### **From Source Code...**

> **Note:** This project should work on all platforms but if you encountered any flaw/error, please, please create an issue and tell me about it.

### ***Direct Way***
Download the zip file from GitHub and unzip it using software like 7-Zip and winRAR.
Most modules that this project uses are included in Python's standard utility modules so you shouldn't have to install anything but just to be sure, please take a look at this list.

- tkinter
- random
- sys
- time
- pygame
- json
- os

After that, run `main_file.py`!

If you don't know how to install modules, you can open your terminal and type in the following command: `pip install <module_name>` or `pip3 install <module_name>`. Another harder but reliable way is to download the tar or zip file and install the module *manually*. You can download the file from websites like [PyPi](https://pypi.org).


> ***Tip: You may have noticed that the project includes a file called 'requirements.txt'.  This file can be used to install required dependencies quickly and easily.  Just cd to the project folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.***
>> If you don't know how to use the cd command, search: "How to use cd command". The syntax is relativly the same on both Linux and Windows

### ***Command Line Way***

#### On Linux...
You could use tools like wget or Git to install.

`git clone <url>`

#### On Windows... 
You could install 3rd party software like [eternallybored.org's Port of GNU Wget](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) or try other build-in ways.

#### On OS X (MacOS)...
You could use Git (like Linux).

`git clone <url>`

> **Important Note:** The command line methods do **not** auto-install the required dependencies.

## **From EXE (Windows only):**
> **Note: The EXE doesn't actually auto-install. It just extracts the contents to a location.**

When you first load onto the project GitHub page, click on the folder that says "EXE releases".  Download the newest one (via wget, git, cURL, directly, or other) and execute it. Pick your location and let it do it's job. Once done, you can go to the folder and you can execute the EXE file. Note that everything in the folder depends on each other so **do NOT** remove **any** files from the folder. If you want, you may create a shortcut of the EXE file and run the batch script.  If done correctly, the app should pop up on your start menu.

# Error Info
 If you encounter an error, please close the app and try again.  If it keeps happening, report the issue on GitHub.
